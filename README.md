The Typing Speed Test App helps users practice typing by displaying a random paragraph. Users type the text in a textbox, and upon submission, the app calculates typing speed in words per minute (WPM), counts errors, and shows time taken. It provides a simple, interactive way to improve typing accuracy and speed.
